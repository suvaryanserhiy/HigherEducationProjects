# Velocity Control using Arrow Keys

This project is a simple HTML page that allows you to control and display velocity using the ArrowUp and ArrowDown keys.
Description

The main purpose of this project is to showcase how to detect key presses using the keydown event in JavaScript and dynamically update the displayed velocity. The page includes information about the keys used for acceleration (ArrowUp) and braking (ArrowDown), and it specifies a velocity limit between 0 and 120.

## Usage

    Open the HTML file (index.html) in a web browser.

    The initial velocity is displayed as "0".

    Press the ArrowUp key to accelerate. The velocity will increase, with a maximum limit of 120.

    Press the ArrowDown key to brake. The velocity will decrease, with a minimum limit of 0.

## Technologies Used

    HTML
    JavaScript
    CSS

## Styling

The velocity display (span) has a background color of mediumslateblue for improved visibility.
